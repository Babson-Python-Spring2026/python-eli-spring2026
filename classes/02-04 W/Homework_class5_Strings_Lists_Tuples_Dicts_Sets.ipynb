    "The problem that felt most awkward without loops was the list to set to list conversion question. My instinct is always to step through the data and control what’s happening element by element, so not being able to explicitly walk it felt  unnatural. I felt the urge to repeat similar operations when I wanted to remove duplicates but still preserve the order because in my head that’s a process, not a one shot conversion. The invariant I violated the most while debugging was assuming that order would stay consistent after converting to a set. I kept expecting the structure to behave like a list even after I changed the data type, which obviously breaks the rule that sets don’t guarantee ordering. Once I slowed down and focused on what properties each data structure actually promises, the confusion cleared up. It really forced me to think more  about what stays constant and what doesn’t when transforming data."
